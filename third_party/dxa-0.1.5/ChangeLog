v0.1.5

- Fixed disassembly with files that get right up to $FFFF; it no longer
  cuts them off abnormally.
- Truncates with an appropriate message for files that extend beyond $FFFF.
  (both of these issues thanks Malte)
- Fixed abnormal branch targets when compiling with clang. Note that dxa-built-
  with-clang detects address tables differently than dxa-built-with-gcc even
  though the assembly output will create an identical binary. There is clearly
  some edge case behaviour going on. To be continued.
- Fixed preprocessor glitch with checking if a label is defined, which caused
  dxa to emit impossible code in some places.
- BASIC header detection allows SYS statements ending with ':', not just $00.
- An actual test suite! Right now it just checks if a file can be disassembled
  and reassembled and come out the same, which is the only thing dxa
  guarantees currently (`make test`).

v0.1.4

- Added BASIC header detection with -u (requires starting address).
  This is experimental in 0.1.4 but will likely be the future default.
- Removed old contact info
- Revised copyrights
- Add ChangeLog
- Patch from Hannu Nuotio for malloc() glitch in label manager
- Patch from Vladimir Rytikov for use-after-free error
- Some safety assertions (report if you hit one of these)

v0.1.3

- Fix absolute addresses that should not be rendered as zero page
- Fix relative addressing glitch
  (thanks Nikkel Holm Olsen for both)

v0.1.2

v0.1.1
- Initial release and fork from d65 0.2.1
